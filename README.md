This is my first full machine_learning project, I used the SVM(Support Vector Machine) model. The na√Øve model had an accuracy of 34% and F-score of  40% and after improving the SVM performance the testing accuracy reached 76% and this is a big improvement(please if you have any ideas to improve it feel free to contact me or to edit in the Jupiter notebook file
